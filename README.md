This is a social reader that will allow users to curate content based on how the content impacts them. In order to this is have created classifications around the basic food groups. 

	Carbohydrate: Content (Article/Website) is classified as a carb if it has a meaningful impact on every individual that is reading it. That means that the content serves to inform the general public, rather than a narrow faction of people who are interested in that content. Content that can be classified as a carbohydrate includes: World News, Politics, Health, Education, Businesses, etc. 

	Protein: Content is classified as a protein if it will have an extremely meaningful impact on a narrow subset of the population. That means that this content serves to inform specific fields about news relating to those fields. A user can select a couple fields in which they are interested in their profile. Examples of content that classifies as proteins are: Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Medicine, Construction, etc. 

	Vegetable: Content is classified as a vegetable if it can have a meaningful impact on every individual that reads it but the content is extremely boring, difficult, or uninteresting to consume. 

	Sweets: Content is classified as a sweet if it will not have a meaningful impact on anyone who consumes it but the content is extremely interesting, entertaining, or social. Examples of sweets are: Comedy, most youtube videos, songs, etc. 

Once data has been classified into food groups, users can go into ('Data Diets'). Meaning they can track their consumption of content posted on the site against the Reccomended Daily Values for their content. 

The purpose of all of this is allow users to be more conscious of the time spent on social reader sites, as well as conscious about how that time will impact them, (more often then not, content on social reader sites like reddit, digg, have no impact on a user, (simply entertainment or superflous knowledge)).
